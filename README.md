# Handbook-1
## About
This repository is my personal learning journal for Python, Selenium, and pytest.  
I use it to practice automation exercises, track my progress, and store useful notes/snippets.

## Contents
- `notes/` → Learning notes, tips, and explanations  
- `examples/` → Small code exercises  
- `projects/` → End-to-end mini-projects (Selenium / pytest)

## How I’m Learning
- Python basics → data types, loops, functions  
- Selenium → web automation and testing  
- pytest → writing test cases, assertions, and reporting  
- Git & GitHub → version control, commits, and pushing projects
